/**
 * Keccak-256, in the browser.
 *
 * ── Why a hash function is in a frontend at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two reasons, and both are the same reason: **so that this bundle never has to be told a number
 * it could derive.**
 *
 *   1. **Function selectors.** `claim()` is a four-byte selector, and `micro-foresight` does not
 *      serve one — there is no claim-intent route (`foresight/src/server.ts:353-800` is the whole
 *      route table, and staking is the only intent it mints). So this app builds the claim
 *      calldata itself. A hard-coded `0x4e71d92d` would be a magic constant nobody could check
 *      without a second tool; derived from the signature, it is checkable by reading the
 *      signature. See `abi.ts`.
 *   2. **The question hash.** `GET /markets/:id` returns the canonical document AND its hash
 *      (`foresight/src/server.ts:433-436`) precisely so a reader can recompute the hash and check
 *      it against the one in the contract, "rather than taking the platform's word that the
 *      criteria have not been edited since it opened" (`server.ts:420-423`). A frontend that
 *      displays the hash the server sent, beside the document the server sent, has verified
 *      nothing. This one recomputes it.
 *
 * ── Why hand-rolled rather than a dependency ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `SubtleCrypto` has SHA-256 and SHA-384 and SHA-512, and no Keccak — and Node's has SHA3-256,
 * which is NOT a substitute: it is the same permutation with a different padding byte (NIST
 * appends `0x06`, Ethereum `0x01`), so using it produces plausible-looking wrong answers. The
 * alternative is a dependency in a bundle whose whole security story is that it ships nothing it
 * has not read.
 *
 * The permutation below is carried across from `foresight/src/keccak.ts:46-164` UNCHANGED, which
 * is itself carried from `wallet/src/keccak.ts`. Two implementations of one primitive in one
 * estate is a difference that presents as a payout refused for a selector the other side computed
 * differently. The one thing not carried is the hex helper: the service's uses `Buffer`, which
 * does not exist here.
 *
 * ── How it is tested, which is the part that matters ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `test/keccak.test.ts` does three things, and the second is the strong one:
 *
 *   1. The published vector, `keccak256("") = c5d24601…`, which pins the domain byte.
 *   2. **The permutation is checked against Node's own SHA3-256** over inputs of every length
 *      around the 136-byte rate boundary. `sha3_256` below is this exact sponge with the NIST
 *      padding byte, so if the permutation, the rate, the lane packing or the absorb loop were
 *      wrong in any way, it would disagree with OpenSSL. That leaves precisely one constant — the
 *      domain byte — unverified by it, which is what (1) pins.
 *   3. The selectors this app actually sends, against their published values.
